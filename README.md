For VocalWriter; a 23 year old, discontinued vocal synthesizer for Power PC Macs 

VocalWriter was a software vocal synthesizer creaded by KAE Labs.
One could think of VocalWriter as a precursor to VOCALOID.
Creator of the software died after the release of version 2.0 and the company is now defunct.
This unfortunately makes it 100% impossible to purchase the software rendering it entirely unusable in the modern day.

It's current unusability poses a problem to it's preservation.

Let's preserve this unique piece of software that opened the door for the vocal synthesizers we have today so that we can 
continue to hear "Hello, Darlin'" for many years.
