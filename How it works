I figured I'd add this file to give an explanation of the system that the software uses to validate.
It's different for both versions but here's a quick rundown.

*****************************************
VocalWriter 1.0
Must be 9 digits
Must have a 7 at digit 6
Individual digits must add up to 39
----------------------------------------
VocalWriter 2.0
Must have 12 digits
Must have 1 at digit 9
Individual digits must add up to 61

****************************************


It's surprisingly simple. You can create a number with nothing but a calculator.
Feel free to take this list and make your own number generator with it. 
Whatever you make will probably be more efficiant than what I made. Mine can fail 1000 times before it gets a valid number.

Just don't take credit for cracking it. If you do, that's kinda sad. :P
